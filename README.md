# What's this site for?
Downloading files generally created by Reper2.

# What can I do with these files?
Use them for anything I guess.

# How did I come up with the idea of this site?
This is kinda how I started coding too. But to explain this, we need to go back to July 2021. At this time I was still using an iPad and my friend liked building shortcuts in the Shortcuts app. So I decided to start building my own shortcuts. My most major shortcut that I was always adding to was like a file directory where you'd choose a file/folder from a menu. When I first began building this site, I didn't think it was gonna be too important so I started building it in basic markdown. Then eventually it grew into proper html with the reuse of a bit of gd browser code.

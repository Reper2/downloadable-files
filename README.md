# File/folder names
Some files/folders have shortened or confusing names, let me help you understand these:
		
		txt-pk = texture pack
		
		nsmbw-txt-pk = New Super Mario Bros. Wii texture pack
		
		guild = server
		
		div = divider
		
		pfp = profile picture(s)
		
		btn = button
		
		771861170256085023 = Reper2verse (server id)
		
		884263560941817916 = RS: Appeals (server id)
		
		RS = Reper2verse
		
There's also other files inside `../discord` that are named using ids, because of the amount of those files, I can't list them here.
